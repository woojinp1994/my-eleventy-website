<p style="margin: 0"> I'm Woojin.</p>

So many people have asked me how they're suppose to pronounce my name. They'll give me a few different versions, but all of these sound the same to me.

As a first generation Korean immigrant, I got to go through the typical experience - coming over in a plane through a visa, learning a whole new language from scratch, and watching my parents struggle with finances. It took a few years of me messing up and being a troublesome teen before I started devoting myself to being academically successful.

I worked extremely hard, but I still consider myself extremely lucky. I managed to get into Harvard - an Asian immigrant's dream school - and got to spend four years learning from the best in their respective fields and making friends with the smartest people I've ever known. 

Now, as an almost thirty year old, I've decided to build this website and start blogging. Not just to help me kickstart my career shift in this extremely tough job market in 2024, but also to have a place to record my thoughts and share my passion. It's never too late to start a diary!

## My Work Experience

As of now, I'm looking for a new role. I've worked in various industries, and I like to think that my many roles have helped me grow into a well-rounded individual.

I've worked as an international educator, a data professional/analytics engineer for several multinational banks, and a people manager for a small credit card company. I know these jobs seem pretty random and disconnected, but there's definitely a good story behind why I chose to take the career path that I did. Ask me about it one day!

I'm extremely proud of the work that I've done. I've helped students get into their dream schools. I've helped build several models and campaigns that brought in hundreds of millions of dollars for banks. I've built a new credit card product from scratch.

Now, I'm looking forward to building my skills as an individual contributor further. I'd like to return to analytics / data engineering and become a subject matter expert in all things data. This website will showcase my interests and my growth towards this new goal.
