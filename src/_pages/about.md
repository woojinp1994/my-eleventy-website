<p style="margin: 0"> I'm Woojin.</p>

So many people have asked me how they're suppose to pronounce my name. They'll give me a few different versions, but all of these sound the same to me.

As a first generation Korean immigrant, I got to go through the typical experience - coming over in a plane through a visa, learning a whole new language from scratch, and watching my parents struggle with finances. It took a few years of me messing up and being a troublesome teen before I started devoting myself to being academically successful.

Now, I have a pretty nice job as a data engineer. On the side, I like to cook extravagant meals for family, friends, and guests. This led me to an adjacent hobby - collecting high end kitchen knives and obsessing over their steel composition, shapes, and fit & finish. In 2023, I took this obsession to a new level - I started forging, grinding, and finishing my own kitchen knives.

## My Experience

TBD

## My Lair

I like to operate out of three primary locations:
    1. My parent-in-law's spare house in Davis, CA
    2. Ace Makerspace in Berkeley, CA
    3. Clay & Steel (Seaport Studios) in Richmond, CA

Where I work out of mainly depends on what I am hoping to learn and improve on at the moment.
