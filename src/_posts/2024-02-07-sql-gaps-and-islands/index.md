If there's one conundrum that I always run into when working with SQL, it's gaps and islands.

In the world of data analysis, accurately interpreting user behavior is crucial for making informed decisions. However, the data we work with, no matter how clean or documented, can naturally be limited by the nature of the format it exists in. For example, consider the following dataset:

<div class="scroll-x">
    <table id="table-1">
    <caption>Table 1: Dataset that tracks active user sessions.</caption>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">User_ID</th>
                <th scope="col" class="numeric">Session_Start</th>
                <th scope="col" class="numeric">Session_End</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 08:00:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 09:00:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 08:30:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 09:30:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 10:00:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 11:00:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-02 08:00:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-02 09:00:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 09:00:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 10:00:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 09:30:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 11:30:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td class="numeric">2024-02-05 10:00:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

This dataset includes four users, each with a variety of session patterns including overlapping sessions, continuous usage without gaps, and minimal, sporadic usage. A user may have more than one session open at a time, or they may not have one open at all. With the data that we have in its current format, we could figure out how long an average session is, but it couldn't tell us things like how long a user is online at a time, or how long periods of inactivity are before they return.
