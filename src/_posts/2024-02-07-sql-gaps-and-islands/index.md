If there's one conundrum that I always run into when working with SQL, it's gaps and islands.

In the world of data analysis, accurately interpreting user behavior is crucial for making informed decisions. However, the data we work with, no matter how clean or documented, can naturally be limited by the nature of the format it exists in. For example, consider the following dataset:

<div class="scroll-x">
    <table id="table-1">
    <caption>Table 1: Dataset that tracks active user sessions.</caption>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">User_ID</th>
                <th scope="col" class="numeric">Session_Start</th>
                <th scope="col" class="numeric">Session_End</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 08:00:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 09:00:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 08:30:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 09:30:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 10:00:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 11:00:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-02 08:00:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-02 09:00:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 09:00:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 10:00:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 09:30:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 11:30:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-03 09:00:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-03 10:00:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-01 10:00:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-05 10:00:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-02 12:00:00</td>
                <td class="numeric">2024-02-02 12:30:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

The "Island and Gaps" problem in SQL is a classic challenge that involves identifying periods of continuous activity (islands) and inactivity (gaps) within datasets. 

This becomes particularly relevant when analyzing user sessions on digital platforms. By refining our approach with a more complex dataset, providing actionable SQL queries, and diving into the analysis, we can uncover valuable insights into user engagement patterns.

## The Flavors

It's surprisingly hard to find a shop that consistently rotates out their seasonal menu with creative, new flavors. I'm not the kind of person to order the same thing at any place. I love trying out new flavors, and won't shy away from introducing new profiles to my palate.

Ampersand changes out their 7-10 seasonal flavors **every month**. Not every season, but every month. That's crazy!

{% include "postImage.html" src: "./images/flavors-ampersand.jpg", alt: "June flavors from 2023." %}

Most of these are made with locally sourced ingredients at the peak of their season. A lot of these flavors are also super exciting and delicious, with my favorites being the blueberry honey, sweet corn, earl grey & cardamom, and warm cookies. A big part of the fun is coming on a new month, checking out the awesome new flavors, and picking out our favorites for the rotation.

Don't get me wrong - their main menu items are absolute perfection. I personally love their honeycomb, bordeaux, and coffee flavors. But there's so much more to life than always eating the same thing every time, even if they are mindblowingly delicious. I'm eternally grateful that Ampersand is always engaging and tickling my ice cream brain with new flavors and profiles that I can't even begin to conceive.

## The End

There just isn't much to be said at this point. Ampersand is the best ice cream ever, and you're just wrong if you disagree with me.

All jokes aside, Ampersand is amazing. If you're ever in the Fresno area, I highly recommend that you give them a friendly visit. In exchange for your business, they will literally change your life.

Stay in tuned for the next coverage of a **gem**. Whenever Margaret and I find a life-changing restaurant or food shop of any sort, we call them a gem and give them our eternal business, for as long as we can be nearby. The next gem post will cover the best ramen I've ever had, on the other side of the United States.
