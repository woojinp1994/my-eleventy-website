We have a tradition.

My parents and my sister have lived in Los Angeles for the past 20 years. I've been all over the place, but Margaret (my wife) and I have recently made the move to live in Davis a couple of years ago.

Since then, we've made the trip from Davis to LA, and back from LA to Davis, numerous times. The first time we went, we took the I-5, passing by some uninteresting places. We would just drive and drive until we got to LA, with a few bathroom stops in between.

On our second drive, we decided to take the State Route 99. There were a few places to stop for lunch and snacks along the way, but we never thought that we would stumble into a place that would change our lives forever. After stopping by Ampersand in Fresno (they have three locations in Fresno, all of which we've visited) for the first time, we were hooked. All we wanted was some ice cream, as a little pick-me-up on our 6-hour journey to a crowded city full of stress and traffic. However, what we ended up finding was a hidden gem.

Now, back to the tradition. Whenever we make the drive to and from Los Angeles, we always stop by Fresno. We may get some lunch or dinner, depending on the time of day, but we **always** stop by Ampersand Ice Cream. We do this because Ampersand is **easily** the best ice cream shop in the world.
